- This executable file should be on the PATH so it can be found
    "$ sudo cp freecad-thumbnailer /usr/bin"
  and must have execution rights
    "$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/freecad-thumbnailer"

- If a FreeCAD project file doesn't include a thumbnail the file org.freecad.FreeCAD.png is used.

    "$ sudo cp freecad-icon-48.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/org.freecad.FreeCAD.png"

- The application/x-extension-fcstd MIME type should be registered
    Check that a corresponding /usr/share/mime/packages/freecad.xml file exists
    Make sure the MIME database is up to date
    "$ sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime"

- Register this thumbnailer
    Adding a file /usr/share/thumbnailers/FreeCAD.thumbnailer with the following content:

    [Thumbnailer Entry]
    TryExec=freecad-thumbnailer
    Exec=freecad-thumbnailer -s %s %i %o
    MimeType=application/x-extension-fcstd;
